# Wake with the Sun

This sunrise alarm app is designed to give you the best time to sleep based on when the sun rises in your city.

## Implementation
Written in jQuery and CSS, this app makes ajax calls to the [sunrise sunset API](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api) to determine current time based on current city.
